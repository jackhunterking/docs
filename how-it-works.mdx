title: "How It Works"

AdsGateway acts as a secure bridge between your AI assistants and advertising platforms. Here's how the pieces fit together.

## The Connection Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="AI Assistant Connects">
    When you add AdsGateway to your AI assistant (like Cursor), it connects to our MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. MCP is an open standard that allows AI tools to securely connect to external services.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Authenticate">
    The first time you use AdsGateway, you'll be prompted to log in. This creates a secure session and allows you to connect your ad platforms.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ad Platform Authorization">
    When you connect an ad platform like Meta, you authorize AdsGateway to read your advertising data. We use OAuth, the industry standard for secure authorization.
    
    <Info>
      AdsGateway analytics tools are read-only. We cannot create, modify, pause, or delete your ads or campaigns.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Tools Become Available">
    Once connected, your AI assistant gains access to AdsGateway tools. These tools let you query your ad data using natural language.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="You Ask Questions">
    When you ask a question like "What was my spend yesterday?", your AI assistant:
    1. Interprets your question
    2. Calls the appropriate AdsGateway tool
    3. Receives the data
    4. Formats it into a helpful response
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Security & Privacy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="OAuth Authentication" icon="shield-check">
    We use OAuth for platform connections. We never store your ad platform password. We store encrypted OAuth tokens while you remain connected so we can serve tool requests on your behalf.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Analytics Are Read-Only" icon="eye">
    Analytics tools only read advertising data. Editing/updating campaigns or ads (budgets, status, creative changes) is **not supported yet**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Encrypted Connections" icon="lock">
    All data is transmitted over HTTPS with TLS 1.3 encryption. Your data is never exposed in transit.
  </Card>
  <Card title="No Data Warehouse" icon="database">
    We fetch ad performance data at request time and do not store full report payloads as a data warehouse. We do keep limited connection metadata and logs.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard developed by Anthropic that allows AI assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources.

<Accordion title="Learn more about MCP">
  MCP provides:
  
  - **Standardized tool definitions**: AI assistants understand what tools are available and how to use them
  - **Secure authentication**: OAuth-based auth ensures only authorized users can access data
  - **Structured responses**: Data is returned in formats that AI can easily interpret and present
  
  AdsGateway implements MCP to ensure compatibility with a wide range of AI assistants including Cursor, Claude, and more.
