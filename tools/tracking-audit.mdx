`meta_tracking_setup_audit` is a read-only troubleshooting tool for post-setup validation and incident response.

<Info>
  This tool does not mutate setup state. It inspects configuration, key health, event processing signals, and drift.

## meta_tracking_setup_audit

### What It Does

Runs a setup health audit and returns:

- Overall health status (`healthy`, `needs_attention`, `needs_fix`)
- Deterministic checks (`checks[]`) and prioritized issues (`issues[]`)
- Event-level coverage/failure signals (`event_level_health`)
- Plan drift signals (`drift_checks`)
- Recommended next tool calls (`next_actions`)
- AI-ready remediation prompts (`ai_fix`)

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `site_id` | string | Conditionally | - | Site to audit (required if `site_url` is not provided) |
| `site_url` | string | Conditionally | - | Site URL to resolve and audit (required if `site_id` is not provided) |
| `lookback_hours` | number | No | 24 | Log analysis window (bounded) |
| `logs_limit` | number | No | 20 | Number of recent logs included in response |

### Output (Key Fields)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether the audit call succeeded |
| `overall_status` | string | `healthy`, `needs_attention`, or `needs_fix` |
| `checks` | array | Deterministic configuration/health checks |
| `issues` | array | Actionable warnings/failures with remediation hints |
| `summary` | object | Status counts, top errors, and event-plan rollups |
| `event_level_health` | array | Per-event seen/failed/deduped health in lookback window |
| `drift_checks` | object | Configured-not-seen and observed-not-selected event drift |
| `next_actions` | array | Suggested follow-up tool calls with example args |
| `ai_fix` | object | AI remediation `prompt_text` + `prompt_template` |
| `recent_logs` | array | Metadata-only recent processing logs |

### Recommended Usage

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run audit first">
    Call `meta_tracking_setup_audit` with `site_id` (or `site_url`) after setup completion or when tracking degrades.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute deterministic follow-ups">
    Use `next_actions` to run the specific tools needed (for example snippets lookup, key rotation, event inspection, or test event verification).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Re-run audit to confirm">
    Re-run the audit and confirm `overall_status` and check statuses improved.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Prompt

```text
Audit tracking setup for site_id "<your-site-id>" over the last 24 hours and list exact next actions.
```
