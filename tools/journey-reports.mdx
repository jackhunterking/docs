title: "Journey Reports"
description: "One-call reports for campaigns, ad sets, and ads (date range + optional comparison)."
---

Journey tools are designed to answer questions like “How is this campaign performing?” in **one call**, without chaining multiple low-level tools.

<Info>
  Journey report tools are read-only. They do not create, edit, pause, or delete campaigns/ads. Editing and ad-writing features are <a href="/feature-availability">Coming Soon</a>.
</Info>

## Common Inputs

All journey report tools accept:

- A required date range: `since` and `until` (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Optional comparison range: `compare_since` + `compare_until` (must be provided together)
- Optional report shape controls:
  - `preset` (metric preset)
  - `time_increment` (daily/weekly, etc.)
  - `breakdowns` (age, country, placement, etc.)
  - `detail_level` (`summary` or `full`)
  - `include_raw` (includes raw platform payloads; can be large)

<Note>
  Usage limits may apply. See <a href="https://adsgateway.io/pricing">Pricing</a>.

## ads_campaign_report

### What It Does

Generates a campaign performance report for a specific date range (with optional comparison and deltas).

### When To Use It

Use this when the user asks:

- “How is this campaign doing this week?”
- “Compare this campaign to last week.”
- “Break down campaign performance by day / country / placement.”

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `platform` | string | Yes | Currently only `meta` is supported |
| `campaign_id` | string | Yes | Meta campaign ID |
| `since` | string | Yes | Start date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `until` | string | Yes | End date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `compare_since` | string | No | Comparison start date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `compare_until` | string | No | Comparison end date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `preset` | string | No | Metric preset (defaults to a performance-oriented preset) |
| `time_increment` | string | No | Time bucket size (e.g., daily) |
| `breakdowns` | array | No | Segment by dimensions (e.g., `["country"]`) |
| `detail_level` | string | No | `summary` or `full` |
| `include_raw` | boolean | No | Include raw platform payloads (can be large) |

### Output (Stable Fields)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether the report was generated |
| `tool` | string | Tool name (`ads_campaign_report`) |
| `tool_version` | string | Version tag (e.g., `v1`) |
| `platform` | string | Platform (`meta`) |
| `entity` | object | Entity metadata (campaign id/name/status, budget fields when available) |
| `range` | object | `{ since, until }` |
| `performance` | object | KPI + conversion summaries + `record_count` |
| `series` | object | Optional time series rows (when requested) |
| `comparison` | object | Optional comparison range + deltas |

### Example Prompts

```text
Generate a campaign report for campaign 123456789 since 2026-02-01 until 2026-02-07
```

```text
Compare campaign 123456789 since 2026-02-01 until 2026-02-07 vs 2026-01-25 to 2026-01-31
```

### Notes & Edge Cases

- `compare_since` and `compare_until` must be provided together.
- If you request `time_increment` or `breakdowns`, the tool may return `series.rows` and may truncate long result sets.
- `include_raw` is intended for debugging and can produce large outputs.

## ads_adset_report

### What It Does

Generates an ad set performance report for a specific date range (with optional comparison and deltas).

### When To Use It

Use this when the user asks:

- “How is this ad set doing?”
- “Which targeting segment is underperforming?”

### Inputs

Same as `ads_campaign_report`, but with `adset_id` instead of `campaign_id`.

### Output (Stable Fields)

Same envelope as `ads_campaign_report`, with `tool: "ads_adset_report"` and `entity.type: "adset"`.

### Example Prompts

```text
Generate an ad set report for ad set 456789123 since 2026-02-01 until 2026-02-07
```

## ads_ad_report

### What It Does

Generates an “ad deep dive” report that includes:

- Creative metadata (headline/body/link/media URLs when available)
- Performance KPIs and conversions
- Optional comparison deltas and a series breakdown

### When To Use It

Use this when the user asks:

- “How is this specific ad performing?”
- “Compare this ad to last week.”
- “Show performance by day/country and include the creative.”

If the user wants OCR text, labels, colors, or logos from the creative, use `meta_analyze_ad_creative`.

### Inputs

Same as `ads_campaign_report`, but with `ad_id` instead of `campaign_id`.

### Output (Stable Fields)

In addition to the shared envelope fields, `ads_ad_report` includes:

- `ad`: compact ad metadata
- `creative`: compact creative metadata (may include media URLs)

### Example Prompts

```text
Generate an ad report for ad 789123456 since 2026-02-01 until 2026-02-07
```
