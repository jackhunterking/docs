## meta_analyze_ad_creative

### What It Does

Analyzes a Meta ad’s creative (image or carousel) and returns facts-only output such as:

- OCR / on-image text
- Detected objects and labels
- Dominant colors
- Detected logos / brand marks (when possible)

### When To Use It

Use this when the user asks:

- “What does this ad say?”
- “Extract the headline/body/on-image text.”
- “What’s in the image?”
- “Does this creative mention a discount?”

If the user wants performance metrics (spend, clicks, ROAS), use `meta_insights_get` or the `ads_*_report` journey tools instead.

### Inputs

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ad_id` | string | Yes | Meta ad ID to analyze |
| `debug` | boolean | No | When true, include diagnostics about which asset sources were used |

### Output (Stable Fields)

| Field | Type | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `success` | boolean | Whether analysis succeeded |
| `ad_id` | string | The analyzed ad id |
| `creative_type` | string | Creative type (e.g., image, carousel) |
| `analysis_status` | string | Status indicator (e.g., completed) |
| `provider` | string | Analysis provider identifier |
| `analysis_version` | string | Version tag |
| `analyzed_at` | string | Timestamp (ISO-8601) |
| `assets` | array | Per-asset analysis results (field set may evolve) |
| `warnings` | array | Non-fatal warnings (e.g., missing assets, low-quality inputs) |
| `usage` | object | Token/usage metadata (may be omitted) |
| `debug` | object | Diagnostics (only when `debug=true`) |

### Example Prompts

```text
Analyze the creative for ad 789123456
```

```text
Extract the on-image text from ad 789123456
```

### Notes & Edge Cases

- Video creatives are not supported in v1.
- If the ad’s media cannot be fetched (permissions, deleted creative, etc.), the tool will return an error or warnings.
- `assets` is designed to evolve; treat it as a structured “facts bundle,” not a fixed schema.
