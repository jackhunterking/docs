## Authentication Issues

### "Authentication required" error

Your session has expired or you haven't logged in yet.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check your connection">
    Ensure your AI assistant shows AdsGateway as connected.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Re-authenticate">
    Try toggling the AdsGateway server off and on in your AI assistant settings.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual login">
    Visit [adsgateway.io](https://adsgateway.io) and log in directly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

### Authentication window doesn't open

The login popup may be blocked.

**Solutions**:
1. Check for blocked popups in your browser
2. Try a different browser
3. Manually visit [adsgateway.io](https://adsgateway.io) and log in

---

### "Invalid token" error

Your authentication token is invalid or expired.

**Solutions**:
1. Disable AdsGateway in your MCP client
2. Remove the AdsGateway MCP entry from your local config
3. Clear browser cookies/session data for:
   - `ads-gateway.onrender.com`
   - `adsgateway.io`
4. Re-add AdsGateway with only this config value:
   - `serverUrl: https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp`
5. Re-enable the server and complete login again

<Note>
  You usually do not need a custom `oauth` block in MCP config. AdsGateway uses OAuth discovery from the server metadata.
</Note>

## Ad Account Issues

### "No ad account selected" error

You need to select an active ad account before querying data.

**Solution**:
```
List my Meta ad accounts
Select the account "Your Account Name"
```

---

### "Account not found" error

The specified account ID doesn't exist or you don't have access.

**Possible causes**:
- Typo in the account ID
- Account was removed from your Business Manager
- Permissions were revoked

**Solution**:
1. List your available accounts to see what you have access to
2. Verify the account ID is correct
3. Check your Facebook Business Manager permissions

---

### Can't see all my ad accounts

AdsGateway can only access accounts you have admin permissions for.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Business Manager">
    Go to Facebook Business Manager and verify your role on each account.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Request access">
    Ask an admin to grant you the necessary permissions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reconnect">
    After permissions are updated, reconnect Meta in AdsGateway to refresh your account list.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data Issues

### "No data available" response

The query returned empty results.

**Possible causes**:
- No ads ran during the specified period
- Account is new with no historical data
- Filters are too restrictive

**Solutions**:
1. Try a broader date range
2. Remove status filters
3. Verify the account has active or historical campaigns

---

### Data seems outdated

Meta Ads data has inherent reporting delays.

| Data Type | Typical Delay |
|-----------|---------------|
| Impressions, clicks | ~15 minutes |
| Spend | ~15 minutes |
| Conversions | Up to 24-48 hours |
| Attribution data | Up to 7 days |

<Info>
  This is a limitation of Meta's reporting system, not AdsGateway. Always check the date range of your data.
</Info>

---

### Numbers don't match Facebook Ads Manager

Minor discrepancies are normal due to:
- **Timing differences**: Data was fetched at different times
- **Attribution windows**: Different attribution settings
- **Timezone differences**: Account vs. query timezone

<Tip>
  For exact comparisons, use the same date range and check that timezones match.
</Tip>

## Connection Issues

### Server not connecting

The AdsGateway server isn't responding.

**Solutions**:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Try restarting your AI assistant
3. Wait a few minutes and try again
4. If the issue persists, contact support at [hello@adsgateway.io](mailto:hello@adsgateway.io)

---

### "Timeout" errors

Requests are taking too long.

**Possible causes**:
- Large data requests
- Network issues
- Server under heavy load

**Solutions**:
1. Try a smaller date range
2. Request fewer metrics at once
3. Use pagination for large result sets
4. Wait and retry

---

### Tools not appearing

Your AI assistant doesn't show AdsGateway tools.

**For Cursor**:
1. Open Settings → MCP
2. Verify AdsGateway server is added
3. Toggle it off and on
4. Restart Cursor

**For Claude Desktop**:
1. Check your `claude_desktop_config.json` file

## Platform-Specific Issues

### Meta: "Permission denied" error

3. Ensure all required permissions are granted
4. Reconnect Meta in AdsGateway if needed

---

### Meta: "Rate limit exceeded" error
