## AI Integration Page Standard (Maintenance Checklist)

Use this checklist for every active AI integration page update:

- Keep section order consistent:
  1. `Prerequisites`

  3. `Use AdsGateway for Analytics`
  4. `Use AdsGateway for Tracking (Pixel + CAPI)`
  5. `Verify Analytics`
  6. `Verify Tracking`
  7. `Troubleshooting`
  8. `Related Docs`
- Ensure analytics and tracking workflows are both present and actionable.
- Include tracking confirmation tokens where relevant.
- Include explicit `meta_tracking_setup_audit` guidance in tracking verification/troubleshooting.
