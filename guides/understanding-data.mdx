# Understanding Your Data

This guide explains the metrics available in AdsGateway and how to interpret them for better decision-making.

## Core Metrics

### Spend

**What it is**: The total amount of money you've spent on ads.

**How it's calculated**: Sum of all costs incurred for impressions, clicks, or actions.

**What good looks like**: This depends on your budget. Monitor for unexpected changes.

```
What was my ad spend yesterday?
```

---

### Impressions

**What it is**: The number of times your ads were displayed on screen.

**How it's calculated**: Each time an ad appears on someone's screen counts as one impression. The same person can generate multiple impressions.

**What good looks like**: More impressions generally means more reach, but quality matters more than quantity.

```
How many impressions did I get last week?
```

---

### Reach

**What it is**: The number of unique people who saw your ads.

**How it's calculated**: Counts each person once, even if they saw your ad multiple times.

**Impressions vs Reach**: If you have 10,000 impressions and 5,000 reach, your average frequency is 2 (each person saw your ad twice).

```
What's my reach for this month?
```

---

### Clicks

**What it is**: The number of times people clicked on your ads.

**Types of clicks**:
- **Link clicks**: Clicks on the ad's destination link
- **All clicks**: Includes link clicks plus clicks on likes, comments, shares, etc.

**What good looks like**: More clicks typically means more engagement, but watch your CTR and conversion rate.

```
How many clicks did I get yesterday?
```

## Efficiency Metrics

### CTR (Click-Through Rate)

**What it is**: The percentage of impressions that resulted in a click.

**Formula**: `CTR = (Clicks ÷ Impressions) × 100`

**What good looks like**:

| Industry | Average CTR |
|----------|-------------|
| E-commerce | 1.0-2.0% |
| B2B | 0.5-1.0% |
| Retail | 1.5-2.5% |
| Finance | 0.5-1.0% |

<Tip>
  A higher CTR means your ad creative and targeting are resonating with your audience.

```
What's my CTR for active campaigns?
```

---

### CPC (Cost Per Click)

**What it is**: The average cost for each click on your ads.

**Formula**: `CPC = Spend ÷ Clicks`

**What good looks like**: Lower is generally better, but not at the expense of quality. A $2 CPC that converts is better than a $0.50 CPC that doesn't.

```
What's my average CPC this week?
```

---

### CPM (Cost Per Mille)

**What it is**: The cost for 1,000 impressions.

**Formula**: `CPM = (Spend ÷ Impressions) × 1000`

**What good looks like**: Varies widely by platform, audience, and competition. US Facebook ads typically range from $5-15 CPM.

```
What's my CPM for my brand awareness campaigns?
```

## Conversion Metrics

### Conversions

**What it is**: The number of desired actions taken after seeing or clicking your ad.

**Types of conversions**:
- Purchases
- Lead form submissions
- Sign-ups
- Add to cart
- App installs
- Page views

**What good looks like**: This depends on your goals. More is generally better, but cost per conversion matters.

```
How many conversions did I get this month?
```

---

### Cost Per Conversion (CPA)

**What it is**: The average cost to acquire one conversion.

**Formula**: `CPA = Spend ÷ Conversions`

**What good looks like**: Should be lower than the value of your conversion. If a customer is worth $100, a $30 CPA is good.

```
What's my cost per conversion?
```

---

### ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)

**What it is**: The revenue generated for every dollar spent on ads.

**Formula**: `ROAS = Revenue ÷ Ad Spend`

**What good looks like**:

| ROAS | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| < 1x | Losing money |
| 1x | Breaking even |
| 2-3x | Good |
| 4-5x | Very good |
| > 5x | Excellent |

<Warning>
  ROAS only measures direct ad revenue. It doesn't include the lifetime value of customers or brand building effects.
</Warning>

```
What's my ROAS for the last 30 days?
```

## Video Metrics

### Video Views

**Types**:
- **3-Second Views**: Number of times your video was watched for 3+ seconds
- **ThruPlay Views**: Watched to completion or 15+ seconds (whichever is shorter)

```
How many ThruPlay views did I get?
```

---

### Video Completion Rate

**What it is**: Percentage of people who watched your video to the end.

**Formula**: `Completion Rate = (Completed Views ÷ Video Starts) × 100`

**What good looks like**:
- 25% completion: Average
- 50%+ completion: Good
- 75%+ completion: Excellent

```
What's my video completion rate?
```

## Engagement Metrics

Likes, loves, hahas, wows, sads, and angrys on your ad.

### Comments

Number of comments on your ad.

### Shares
