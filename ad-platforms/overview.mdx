## How Connections Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a Platform">
    Select the advertising platform you want to connect from the list above.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authorize Access">
    You'll be redirected to the platform's login page to authorize AdsGateway. This uses OAuth, the industry standard for secure authorization.
    
    <Info>
      AdsGateway analytics tools are **read-only**. We cannot create, modify, pause, or delete campaigns/ads. Optional tracking features (Pixel + Conversions API) require explicit enablement and confirmations.

    After authorization, you'll see all ad accounts you have access to. Select which accounts you want to use with AdsGateway.

    Once connected, you can query your ad data through any supported AI assistant.
