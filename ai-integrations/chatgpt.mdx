# ChatGPT

AdsGateway works with ChatGPT through a custom widget that provides rich data visualization.

<Info>
  The ChatGPT integration uses a widget rather than native MCP, which allows for richer data display including charts and formatted tables.
</Info>

## How It Works

Unlike Cursor and Claude which use native MCP connections, ChatGPT uses:

1. **Custom GPT**: A specialized GPT configured to work with AdsGateway
2. **Widget UI**: Rich data visualization for ad metrics and insights
3. **OAuth Authentication**: Secure connection to your ad accounts

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the AdsGateway GPT">
    Visit the AdsGateway GPT in the ChatGPT store:
    
    <Card title="AdsGateway GPT" icon="openai" href="https://chatgpt.com/g/adsgateway">
      Open in ChatGPT
    </Card>
    
    Or search for "AdsGateway" in ChatGPT's GPT store.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start a Conversation">
    Click "Start Chat" to begin using AdsGateway.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    When you first ask about your ads, ChatGPT will prompt you to connect:
    
    1. Click the authentication link
    2. Log in to your AdsGateway account
    3. Connect your Meta account if not already connected
    4. Return to ChatGPT
    
    <Check>
      Once authenticated, you'll see your ad data displayed in the widget
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>
