Claude supports MCP (Model Context Protocol) connections in both Claude Code (CLI) and Claude Desktop. This guide shows you how to connect AdsGateway to either version.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) or [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) installed
- An [AdsGateway account](https://adsgateway.io)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Claude Code">
    ## One-Command Installation
    
    Run this command in your terminal to add AdsGateway to Claude Code:
    
    ```bash
    claude mcp add --scope project --transport http "Ads Gateway" "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
    ```
    
    <Info>
      This command adds AdsGateway as an MCP server scoped to your current project using HTTP transport.
    </Info>
    
    ### What this command does
    
    - Adds `Ads Gateway` as an MCP server
    - Configures HTTP transport for the connection
    - Scopes to your current project
    
    ### Authentication
    
    After adding the server, Claude Code will prompt you to authenticate:
    
    1. A browser window opens automatically
    2. Log in to your AdsGateway account (or create one)
    3. Authorize the connection
    4. Return to Claude Code and start using your ad tools!
    
    <Check>
      Your credentials are securely handled via OAuth 2.1 through Supabase Auth.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Claude Desktop">
    ## Step 1: Find your config file
    
    Locate the Claude Desktop configuration file on your system:
    
    | Platform | Config File Location |
    |----------|---------------------|
    | **macOS** | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` |
    | **Windows** | `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` |
    
    <Tip>
      If the file doesn't exist, create it. Make sure the Claude folder exists first.
    </Tip>
    
    ## Step 2: Add the MCP server
    
    Add this configuration to your config file:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Ads Gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    <Warning>
      If you already have other MCP servers configured, merge the `Ads Gateway` entry into your existing `mcpServers` object.
    </Warning>
    
    ## Step 3: Restart Claude Desktop
    
    After saving the configuration file:
    
    1. **Completely quit** Claude Desktop (not just close the window)
    2. Reopen Claude Desktop
    3. The MCP server will be automatically loaded
    
    ### Authentication
    
    When you first use AdsGateway tools, Claude Desktop will prompt you to authenticate:
    
    1. A browser window opens automatically
    2. Log in to your AdsGateway account (or create one)
    3. Authorize the connection
    4. Return to Claude Desktop and start using your ad tools!
    
    <Check>
      Your credentials are securely handled via OAuth 2.1 through Supabase Auth.
    </Check>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Verify the Connection
