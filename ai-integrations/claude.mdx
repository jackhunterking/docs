# Claude

Claude is Anthropic's AI assistant with full MCP support. This guide covers setup for both **Claude Desktop** and **Claude Code**.

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) or Claude Code installed
- An [AdsGateway account](https://adsgateway.io)

## Setup for Claude Desktop

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate the Configuration File">
    Claude Desktop stores MCP configuration in a JSON file:
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="macOS">
        ```bash
        ~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Windows">
        ```bash
        %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
    
    <Tip>
      If the file doesn't exist, create it.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add AdsGateway Configuration">
    Open the configuration file and add the AdsGateway server:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "ads-gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    If you already have other MCP servers configured, add `ads-gateway` to the existing `mcpServers` object:
    
    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "existing-server": {
          "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
        },
        "ads-gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Restart Claude Desktop">
    Close and reopen Claude Desktop for the changes to take effect.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    When you first use an AdsGateway tool, Claude will prompt you to authenticate:
    
    1. Click the authentication link
    2. Log in to your AdsGateway account
    3. Authorize the connection
    4. Return to Claude Desktop
    
    <Check>
      You should see AdsGateway tools available in Claude's tool list
    </Check>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setup for Claude Code

Claude Code uses a similar configuration approach. Add the AdsGateway server to your MCP settings following the same JSON format as above.

## Verify the Connection

Start a new conversation and try:

```
Can you list my Meta ad accounts using AdsGateway?
```

Claude should call the AdsGateway tool and display your accounts.
