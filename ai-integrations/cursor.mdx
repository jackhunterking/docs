Cursor is an AI-powered code editor with built-in MCP support. This guide shows you how to add AdsGateway to Cursor.

<Info>
  Cursor is our recommended AI assistant for developers. It has the smoothest MCP integration.
</Info>

## Prerequisites

- [Cursor](https://cursor.sh) installed on your computer
- An [AdsGateway account](https://adsgateway.io)

## One-Click Installation (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started — just click the button below:

<a href="cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=Ads%20Gateway&config=eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL2Fkcy1nYXRld2F5Lm9ucmVuZGVyLmNvbS9tY3AifQ==">

    style={{height: '40px', cursor: 'pointer'}}
  />
</a>

<Tip>
  The button above opens Cursor and automatically configures the AdsGateway MCP server for you. No manual editing needed.
</Tip>

## Manual Setup

If the one-click button doesn't work, you can configure it manually. Choose **one** of the two options below:

### Option A: Use the "Add MCP Server" Button in Cursor

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Cursor Settings">
    Open Cursor and go to **Settings** (Cmd/Ctrl + ,)

    Or click the gear icon in the bottom left corner.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to MCP Settings">
    In the settings sidebar, find and click on **Tools & MCP**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click 'Add MCP Server'">
    Click the **+ Add new MCP server** button. A JSON editor will open.

    **Replace the entire contents** with the following:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Ads Gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    Then click **Save**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable the Server">
    Toggle the AdsGateway server to **ON** in the MCP settings panel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Option B: Edit the MCP Config File Directly

If you already have other MCP servers configured, this is the safest approach.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the MCP config file">
    Open the file at `~/.cursor/mcp.json` in any text editor.

    If the file doesn't exist, create it with this content and you're done:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "Ads Gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add AdsGateway to your existing servers">
    If you already have other MCP servers in the file, **add only this line** inside the existing `"mcpServers"` block:

    ```json
    "Ads Gateway": {
      "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
    }
    ```

    **Example** — if your file currently looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "some-other-server": {
          "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    It should look like this **after** adding AdsGateway:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "some-other-server": {
          "url": "https://example.com/mcp"
        },
        "Ads Gateway": {
          "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    <Warning>
      **Don't nest `mcpServers` inside `mcpServers`!** A common mistake is pasting the full JSON block (including the outer `"mcpServers"` wrapper) inside your existing config. This creates an invalid nested structure that causes errors.

      ❌ **Wrong** — nested `mcpServers`:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "some-other-server": { ... },
          "mcpServers": {
            "Ads Gateway": {
              "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
            }
          }
        }
      }
      ```

      ✅ **Correct** — `Ads Gateway` is a direct entry:
      ```json
      {
        "mcpServers": {
          "some-other-server": { ... },
          "Ads Gateway": {
            "url": "https://ads-gateway.onrender.com/mcp"
          }
        }
      }
      ```
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and restart Cursor">
    Save the file, then restart Cursor (or toggle the server off and on in MCP settings).
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Authenticate

When you first enable the server, Cursor will open your browser for authentication.

1. Log in to your AdsGateway account (or create one)
2. Authorize the connection
3. You'll be redirected back to Cursor

<Check>
  Look for the green "Connected" status in Cursor's MCP panel
</Check>

## Verify the Connection

Once connected, try this command in Cursor's AI chat:

```
List my Meta ad accounts
```

You should see a list of your connected ad accounts.

## Available Commands

After setup, you can ask Cursor questions like:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Account Management">
    - "List my Meta ad accounts"
    - "Select the account called 'My Business'"
    - "Which account am I currently using?"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Campaign Data">
    - "Show me all active campaigns"
    - "List ad sets in my Brand Awareness campaign"
    - "Get details for ad ID 123456789"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance Insights">
    - "What was my spend in the last 7 days?"
    - "Show me impressions and clicks for yesterday"
    - "Get my ROAS for this month"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="AI Analysis">
    - "Give me an account summary"
    - "Which campaigns improved the most this week?"
    - "Are there any anomalies in my ad performance?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'Must have either a command (for stdio) or url (for SSE)' error">
    This usually means there is a formatting issue in your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` file. The most common cause is **nesting `mcpServers` inside `mcpServers`** — this happens when you paste the full JSON block inside an existing config.

    **How to fix:**
    1. Open `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
    2. Make sure there is only **one** `"mcpServers"` key at the top level
    3. Ensure `"Ads Gateway"` is placed **directly** inside `"mcpServers"`, not inside another nested object
    4. See the [Manual Setup — Option B](#option-b-edit-the-mcp-config-file-directly) section above for the correct format
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Server shows as disconnected">
    1. Check your internet connection
    2. Try toggling the server OFF and ON again
    3. If the issue persists, restart Cursor
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication window doesn't open">
    1. Check if pop-ups are blocked in your browser
    2. Try manually visiting [adsgateway.io](https://adsgateway.io) and logging in
    3. Then toggle the MCP server off and on again
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Authentication required' error">
    Your session may have expired. Toggle the server off and on to re-authenticate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="No tools available">
    1. Make sure the server is toggled ON
    2. Check that authentication completed successfully
    3. Try restarting Cursor
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="JSON syntax errors in mcp.json">
    If Cursor isn't loading any MCP servers, your JSON file may have a syntax error.

    Common issues:
    - **Missing comma** between server entries
    - **Trailing comma** after the last entry (not allowed in JSON)
    - **Duplicate keys** — only one `"mcpServers"` block is allowed

    **Tip:** Paste your `~/.cursor/mcp.json` contents into [jsonlint.com](https://jsonlint.com) to validate the syntax.
