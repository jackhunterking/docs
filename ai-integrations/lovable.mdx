Lovable is an AI-powered app builder that lets you create web applications using natural language. This guide shows you how to connect AdsGateway to Lovable via its Custom MCP connector.

  Lovable supports MCP through its **Connectors** feature. You can add AdsGateway as a custom MCP server to query your ad data directly from the Lovable chat.
